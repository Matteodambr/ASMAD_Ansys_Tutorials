# ASMAD STRUCTURES SEMINAR

This repository contains all sharable material used in class during the ASMAD STR seminar. The results have not been saved to limit the size of the repository, but can be generated with Ansys 2024 R1 (or later, Ansys models are forward-compatible). The models are lightweight such that they can be run regardless of your machine, and should only be used as representative examples and as quick references when developing your more complex models for the ASMAD project.

## Available models:
1. Cantilever beam
2. Simplified spacecraft

## Useful spacecraft structures references
These references can be found in the folder "References" in the ASMAD_Ansys_Tutorials repository, and should be included in your bibliography, if used. You are not required to read all of them, but they can be useful to look over. For additional standards, check https://ecss.nl/list-of-published-ecss-standards-long/.

1. Your selected launchers' user manual! (Typically found online, just search for it.)
2. ECSS-E-HB-32-26A, Spacecraft mechanical loads analysis handbook.
3. ECSS-E-ST-10-03C Rev.1, Testing
4. GSFC-STD-7000B, GEVS - General Environment Verification Standard NASA
5. ECSS-E-ST-32-11C, Modal Survey Assessment
6. ECSS-E-ST-32-03C, Structural Finite Element Models
7. ECSS-E-ST-32C Rev.1, Structural General Requirements
8. ECSS-E-ST-32-10C Rev.2, Structural Factors of Safety for Spaceflight Hardware

For CubeSats only:

1. TEC-SY-128-2013-SPD-RWv1.3, Tailored ECSS Engineering Standards for In-Orbit Demonstration CubeSat Projects.
2. ESA-TECSP-TN-014252, Launch environment loads guidelines for ESA IOD CubeSat missions.

## Useful Ansys references:
The easiest way to conduct a specific analysis for your project is to take a look at the respective tutorial, from the Ansys learning forum or on youtube; these tutorials typically go sufficiently in depth for what is required for the ASMAD projects. If you still have questions after watching the tutorial, feel free to ask questions.
